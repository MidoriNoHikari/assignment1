  <h1> Matthew Snyder </h1>
  <span> My web development experience so far:
  <ul>
    <li> Intro to HTML [from Engineering Analysis aka ENGR 0011] </li>
	<li> CSS/Microsoft Sharepoint Content Management System [first co-op rotation] </li>
	<li> EXT JS [second co-op rotation] </li>
  </ul>
  <ul> 
    <li> I'm a Computer Engineering major here at the University, currently in my sixth semester. At this point in my career I'd say I'm probably most interested in Network Security, but I haven't had a chance to take many classes in that yet.</li>
    <li> My hobbies are wide and varied, from reading to playing video games, as well as sabre fencing. I'd much rather play sports than watch them, so don't expect to find me at any football or basketball games. </li>
    <li> When it comes to pop culture I know tremendously little, so don't ask me about any currently airing TV shows unless they are related to superheroes or science fiction. I watch a decent amount of anime as well, but that's <i>partially</i> because I'm trying to improve my language skills. </li>
  </ul>
    <!--
      In this section (<body>), create a h1 tag stating your name
      Beneath that, create an unordered list with at least 3 list items
      that describe your web development experience (if any, it's ok if this is all new :D)

      This is just a quick exercise to show that you know how to work with git and GitHub
      No styling or scripting is required for this assignment

      If you don't know how to make the above mentioned tags, either take a look around on
      the internet, or don't hesitate to ask me!
